                <p>From this project I learned emotion Is all around me and can be displayed In real life 

situations without words being present. I also learned that colors can help viewers better 

understand the meaning of something. Another thing I learned Is that some boring spaces can 

be created into something fun crazy or beautiful all together.</p>
